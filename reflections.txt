# How long did you spend working on this project?

3 hours.

# What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
finishing this project!

# What two additional features did you build? Why?

1. Add NoRecordError notifications for errors where a record doesn't exist
- There were cases that could have failed without giving an informative error. 
-- Customer.find_by_name
-- Product.find_by_title
-- Transaction.find

2. Add ability to get purchase history
- As a customer I would like to retreive my purchase history. This could be used for a dashboard/report in a future feature.

# Where do you still have room to grow?

Making my code and choice of ruby features more succint.
